# Flat Panel Assist
My German Equatorial mount ascom driver does not support slew to alt or slew to az. 
I needed to slew to the position of my Flat Light Panel to do my Flats
This simple application allows me to store the position of my flat panel and slew to it by converting fixed Alt Az to current Ra Dec coordinates

Enjoy
